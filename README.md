Repo contains the work I did at Newrun Technology Pvt Ltd during a part-time internship. I compiled a faces dataset that contains (around 900) non-celebrity faces shot with some variety in shooting angle and lighting. I cannot share the dataset so collected because more than one component dataset mention that their data is not to be redistributed. Also in the repo is a script that makes it convenient to prepare the dataset for testing. The script also contains code to run tests using sklearn-type classifiers conveniently.
